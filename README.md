# Fitness-Tracking-Data-K-Means
The "Fitness Tracker Data Clustering" report presents an analysis of simulated fitness tracker data using the KMeans clustering algorithm to identify distinct user groups based on daily step counts and sleep duration.

Conducted in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment with Python, the project leverages libraries such as scikit-learn, NumPy, and Matplotlib for data manipulation, clustering, and visualization. The report aims to demonstrate the utility of clustering in exploratory data analysis, highlighting trends in activity levels and sleep patterns, and serves as a practical learning exercise in data science.

Description
Introduction
The report introduces the objective of using clustering techniques to analyze simulated fitness tracker data. The primary goal is to segment users into groups based on two key metrics: daily steps (activity level) and sleep duration. This approach aids in identifying behavioral trends, showcasing the value of clustering in understanding user habits. The learning objectives include:

Utilizing Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab for data manipulation and analysis.
Gaining hands-on experience with scikit-learn and NumPy.
Visualizing data effectively with Matplotlib.
Applying clustering algorithms to categorize users by sleep and activity patterns.
Methodology and Data Visualization
The analysis begins with a scatter plot of raw fitness tracker data, plotting daily steps on the x-axis and sleep time on the y-axis. This initial visualization helps identify preliminary trends before clustering. The data is generated synthetically using NumPy, with random values assigned to three user groups:

Group 1: High activity (8,000–12,000 steps) and 7–9 hours of sleep.
Group 2: Moderate activity (5,000–8,000 steps) and 6–7 hours of sleep.
Group 3: Low activity (2,000–5,000 steps) and 5–6 hours of sleep.
The code snippet provided sets a random seed for reproducibility, generates data for each group, and combines it into a matrix for clustering.

KMeans Clustering Implementation
The KMeans algorithm from scikit-learn is applied with three clusters to group users based on their activity and rest patterns. The implementation includes:

Fitting the model to the data matrix with n_clusters=3, random_state=42, and n_init=10 for consistency.
Assigning cluster labels to each user, enabling comparison of behavioral differences.
Cluster Visualization and Analysis
Visualization: A scatter plot with distinct colors (red, green, orange) is created to represent the three clusters, illustrating how users are grouped by sleep duration and fitness levels.
Findings:
Cluster 1 (Highly Active): Users with 7–9 hours of sleep and high step counts (8,000–12,000).
Cluster 2 (Moderately Active): Users with 6–7 hours of sleep and moderate step counts (5,000–8,000).
Cluster 3 (Least Active): Users with 5–6 hours of sleep and low step counts (2,000–5,000). (Note: The OCR error mentioning "2019" seems to be a misread and is likely intended as part of the sleep range.)
The code includes a section to compute and print the average movement (steps) and rest duration for each cluster, though syntax errors in the provided code (e.g., cluster_points = data_matrix(cluster_labels = = index)) suggest it may not execute as shown.

Notes on Limitations
The OCR process introduced significant errors, particularly on Pages 2, 4, and 5, with repetitive "5" and "0.0" sequences and corrupted code syntax. This affects the completeness of the methodology and results sections.
The intended number of members for Group 3 (members_group3) is incomplete, and some variable names (e.g., m|owement) contain OCR artifacts, requiring correction (e.g., to movement).
The analysis assumes three clusters, but the code’s execution and full results are not fully verifiable due to these issues.
Summary
This report effectively demonstrates the application of KMeans clustering to segment fitness tracker data into meaningful user groups, offering insights into activity and sleep patterns. Despite OCR-related challenges, it provides a solid foundation for learning data manipulation, visualization, and clustering techniques, with potential for refinement through corrected code and additional data validation.
